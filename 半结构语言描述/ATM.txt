System Description
Introduction
ATM (Automated Teller Machine) is one of the most widely used financial systems in daily life. Beyond basic functions such as cash withdrawal and deposit, ATMs also offer services like account balance inquiries, transfers, and password resets. The ATM system must ensure high security and stability to protect users' financial information. Additionally, user-friendliness is crucial, so ATMs often include features such as language selection and screen brightness adjustment.
